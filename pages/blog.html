        <h2>üåê Getting Started with HTML & CSS</h2>
          <p><small>Posted on Sept 18, 2025</small></p>
          <p>
           When I first opened a text editor and wrote 
          <code>&lt;h1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt;</code>, it felt like magic. 
          That single line of HTML created something I could actually see in my browser. 
          With <strong>HTML</strong>, I learned how to structure a page‚Äîlike writing the 
          blueprint of a building.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then came <strong>CSS</strong>, the paintbrush of the web. Suddenly, I could 
            change colors, add spacing, and make my page feel alive. Watching a dull page 
            transform into something stylish with just a few lines of CSS was addictive.
          </p>
          <p>
             Together, HTML and CSS gave me the power to turn simple text into a 
             visually appealing website‚Äîand that‚Äôs where the real excitement began.

         <h2>üöÄ Diving Into JavaScript</h2>
           <p><small>Posted on Sept 18, 2025</small></p>
           <p>
             The real turning point in my web development journey was discovering 
             <strong>JavaScript</strong>. It‚Äôs the secret ingredient that makes a static 
             page interactive.
            </p>
            <p>
               A button that opens a menu, a form that validates itself, or even a simple 
               animation‚Äîall of that happens thanks to JavaScript. It felt like I had given 
               my websites a personality of their own.
            </p>
            <p>
               Learning JavaScript taught me that websites aren‚Äôt just about looking good; 
               they can also <em>react, respond, and adapt</em> to the user. That‚Äôs when my 
               coding journey truly came alive.
